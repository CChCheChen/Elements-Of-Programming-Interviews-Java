20.8 IMPLEMENT A TIMER CLASS

Consider a web-based calendar in which the server hosting the calendar has to perform a task when the next calendar event takes place. 
(The task could be sending an email or a Short Message Service (SMS).) 

Your job is to design a facility that manages the execution of such tasks.

Develop a timer class that manages the execution of deferred tasks. 
The timer constructor takes as its argument an object which includes a run method and a string-valued name field. 

The class must support¡ª
(1.) Starting a thread, identified by name, at a given time in the future; and 
(2.) Canceling a thread, identified by name (the cancel request is to be ignored if the thread has already started).

Hint: There are two aspects¡ªdata structure design and concurrency.
