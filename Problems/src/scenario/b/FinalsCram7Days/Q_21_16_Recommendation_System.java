21.16 DESIGN A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Jingle wants to generate more page views on its news site. 
A product manager has the idea to add to each article a side-bar of click-able snippet from articles that are likely to be of interest to someone reading the current article.

Design a system that automatically generates a side-bar of related articles.

Hint: This problem can be solved with various degrees of algorithmic sophistication: none at all, simple frequency analysis, or machine learning.
